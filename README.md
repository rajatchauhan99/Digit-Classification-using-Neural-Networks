**Project Title: Digit Classification using Neural Networks**

**Summary:**

🚀 **Project Overview:**
I successfully implemented a digit classification project using TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on the MNIST dataset—a classic multi-class classification problem. The objective was to train a neural network to accurately identify handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

🖼️ **Data Preprocessing:**
The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits. To prepare the data for training, I used max-min scaling to bring pixel values from the original range of (0 to 255) to a normalized range of (0 to 1). This preprocessing step is crucial for optimizing neural network training performance.

🔧 **Neural Network Architecture:**
I designed a Sequential model with a Flatten layer to convert the 2D image data into a 1D array. The architecture included two dense hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, and an output layer with 10 nodes using the softmax activation function—suitable for multi-class classification.

💡 **Key Steps:**
1. **Flatten Layer:** Conversion of 2D image data to 1D array.
2. **Dense Hidden Layers:** 128 nodes with ReLU activation.
3. **Output Layer:** 10 nodes with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
4. **Model Compilation:** Used the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

📈 **Model Training:**
The model was trained over multiple epochs, and training/validation accuracy was visualized using matplotlib. I observed significant performance improvements over training epochs.

👩‍💻 **Code Snippet:**
